//  [Analogy for the Race-Condition:]

//  üèéÔ∏è The Fast Food Drive-Thru Analogy üçî
//  Imagine you and your friend pull up to a fast food drive-thru that has two order windows,
//  but only one kitchen preparing the food.
 
//  1)Scenario 1: No Race Condition (Synchronized Orders) ‚úÖ

//  ~You pull up first, place your order for a double cheeseburger üçî,
//   and the cashier confirms it before moving on.
//   Your friend pulls up next and orders a chicken sandwich üçó.
//   The kitchen receives both orders in the correct order and prepares them properly.
//   You get your cheeseburger, your friend gets their chicken sandwich. All good!


//  2)Scenario 2: Race Condition (Chaos in the Kitchen) ‚ùå

//  ~You and your friend accidentally talk at the same time into the speaker.
//   The cashier only hears:
//   You: "Double..."
//   Friend: "...sandwich"
//   The kitchen receives an incomplete/confused order and prepares a random meal.
//   The food comes out wrong‚Äîyou get a chicken cheeseburger you never ordered! üò§

// ~ init_mutexes is a function that initialises the mutex lock,
//   (which are used to prevent the race conditions.)
// ~ It loops through all the forks and initialises one mutex for each philos.
// ~ It also initialises a writing_lock mutex, which is most likely used to 
//   control the output printing (thus multiple threads dont print at the same
//   time and mess up the output).

void 	init_mutexes(t_data *data)
{
	int i; //loop counter to initialise multiple forks.
	int error; //stores return values which tells us succsess or failure.

	i = 0;
	while (i < data->total_philo_num) // a loop that runs once for each philo.
	{
		error = pthread_mutex_init(&(data->fork[i]), NULL);//the threads i am using is a library instead of a actual funtion.
		if (error != 0)
			print_error(3);
		i++;
	}
	error = pthread_mutex_init(&(data->writing_lock), NULL);
	if (error != 0)
		print_error(3);
}

// Above is the original one, that feel like was correct but then when i look deeper into the
// code i realize its too complex for me to understand, thus i came up with my own one.

void	init_single_mutex(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
{
	if(pthread_mutex_init(mutex, NULL) != 0)
	{
		print_error(3);
	}
}

void	init_mutex(t_data *data)
{
	int i;

	i = 0;
	while ( i < data->total_philo_num)
	{
		init_single_mutex(&(data->fork[i]));//initialise a mutex for each fork and passes a adress of the fork mutex for the i-th philo.
		i++;
	}
	init_single_mutex(&(data->writing_lock));// Creates a mutex, to prevent multiple threads from printing.
}
  


// What is a mutex??

// Final Analogy:Mutex = A lock on a bathroom door....

// ~ Imagine multiple people(threads in this case) wants to use a shared bathroom(fork).
// ~ We put a lock on the door(mutex) so only one person can acsess the bathroom at a time.
// ~ If we forget to add a lock, then multiple people can try and acsess the bathroom
// 	at the same time, which may cause chaos(race condition).
// ~ The writing lock ensures that only one person can write on the board(print on the screen)
// 	at a time.
